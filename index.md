## Class-Optimizer

With the vast number of courses on offer at the University of Illinois and the wide variation in average GPA, instructor quality, prereqs, and number of GenEds fulfilled, picking the best course to take is hard.

Class-Optimizer allows any student to select a personalized optimization strategy for picking the best course for your graduation needs. The student simply ranks their priorities according to their personal preferences like so:

Maximize the following priorities (ranked)
1. the number of previously unfulfilled GenEds met is maximized
2. the average GPA is maximized
3. the average rate my professor score is maximized
subject to:
- no class before 11 AM.

and the optimizer will use [constrained optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constrained_optimization) to provide the top classes that fit the hard and soft constraints.
